# Description #

<img src="/assets/images/docs/api_illustrations/connect_ruby.png" class="api_command_illustration" />

Create a new connection to the database server.  Accepts the following
options:

- `host`: the host to connect to (default `localhost`).
- `port`: the port to connect on (default `28015`).
- `db`: the default database (default `test`).
- `auth_key`: the authentication key (default none).
- `timeout`: timeout period in seconds for the connection to be opened (default `20`).

If the connection cannot be established, a `RqlDriverError` exception will be thrown.

The authentication key can be set from the RethinkDB command line tool. Once set, client connections must provide the key as an option to `run` in order to make the connection. For more information, read "Using the RethinkDB authentication system" in the documentation on [securing your cluster](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/security/).

__Example:__ Opens a connection using the default host and port but specifying the default database.

```rb
conn = r.connect(:db => 'marvel')
```

__Example:__ Opens a new connection to the database.

```rb
conn = r.connect(:host => 'localhost',
                 :port => 28015,
                 :db => 'heroes',
                 :auth_key => 'hunter2')
```
